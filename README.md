# Gwen-Lee-Portfolio
Profile Page for Gwen Lee, Front End Web Developer

This is my first website, built from scratch.  It could still use a few tweeks to the design.  I focused on handwriting the code myself, not using any libraries.  I also focused on making sure the HTML was semantic and the design was responsive to all screen sizes.
